# Gesture-Interaction-with-Arduino-through-MQTT

When a person gets close to a smart object,
the smart object starts the interaction session and notifies the user (e.g. by turning on an LED
on the smart object Figure 1). The user can interact with the smart device through hand
gestures by using a braclet containing gyro and accelerometer.
